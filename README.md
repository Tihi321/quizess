## Technologies
**OO PHP** + **React** for *blocks*, *admin dahboard*, *menu* and *frontend quiz*. Plugin utilizes **REST Api** to decouple Wordpress backend and UI. That way we can use frontend libraries (like React, VUE, Angular) to create Web Apps and still use Wordpress for backend, we can also extend Wordpress admin.
